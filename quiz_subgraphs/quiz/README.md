# Getting started

+ Install Rust via rustup, go on the [rustup website](https://rustup.rs/) and follow the instructions.
+ Launch the subgraph using `cargo run`
+ It will expose GraphQL server on http://localhost:4005 by default (without any path in the URL).
+ If you want to change the port, simply expose another `PORT` env variable.
